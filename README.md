Introduction: Tracking Scenarios

In this project, you have the opportunity to explore three tracking scenarios by entering unique codes. I used Material UI, following the setup suggested by the repository, and implemented JSX, BEM naming with Sass for structured organization. Additionally, I applied fade effects in the stylesheet to enhance the experience. Let's begin exploring the three tracking search scenarios by inputting the codes from the table below!

| Scenario   | Tracking Code |
|------------|---------------|
| Scenario 1 | 100           |
| Scenario 2 | 200           |
| Scenario 3 | 300           |
